Test leaves were subjected to a range of temperatures, humidities, photon irradiances and external COz mol fractions. An empiral function, g,, = go + glAh,/(cs- I?), was able to account for steadystate stomatal conductances g,,, over a wide range of environmental conditions and leaf photosynthetic capacities. In this equation, termed the stomatal constraint function, A is C02 assimilation rate, h, and c, are relative humidity and COz mol fraction at the leaf surface respectively, r is the C02 compensation point, go is conductance at A = 0 and gl is an empirical coefficient. Equations describing the supply of C02 through stomata and demand for C02 in photosynthesis were solved simultaneously with the constraint function to give a combined model of stomatal conductance, C02 assimilation and intercellular COz mol fraction in terms of external environmental factors and several parameters describing Cg photosynthesis. The model provided a good description of experimental observations.},

	abstract = {Gas-exchange measurements on Eucalyptus grandis leaves and data extracted from the literature were used to test a semi-empirical model of stomatal conductance for CO2 gSc=go+a1A/(cs-I) (1+Ds/Do) where A is the assimilation rate; Ds and cs are the humidity deficit and the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface, respectively; g0 is the conductance as A → 0 when leaf irradiance → 0; and D0 and a1 are empirical coefficients. This model is a modified version of gsc=a1A hs/cs first proposed by Ball, Woodrow \& Berry (1987, in Progress in Photosynthesis Research, Martinus Mijhoff, Publ., pp. 221--224), in which hs is relative humidity. Inclusion of the CO2 compensation point, τ, improved the behaviour of the model at low values of cs, while a hyperbolic function of Ds for humidity response correctly accounted for the observed hyperbolic and linear variation of gsc and ci/cs as a function of Ds, where Ci is the intercellular CO2 concentration. In contrast, use of relative humidity as the humidity variable led to predictions of a linear decrease in gsc and a hyperbolic variation in ci/cs as a function of Ds, contrary to data from E. grandis leaves. The revised model also successfully described the response of stomata to variations in A, Ds and cs for published responses of the leaves of several other species. Coupling of the revised stomatal model with a biochemical model for photosynthesis of C3 plants synthesizes many of the observed responses of leaves to light, humidity deficit, leaf temperature and CO2 concentration. Best results are obtained for well-watered plants.},

	abstract = {The ascent of water from the soil to the leaves of vascular plants, described by the study of plant hydraulics, regulates ecosystem responses to environmental forcing and recovery from stress periods. Several approaches to model plant hydraulics have been proposed. In this study, we introduce four different versions of plant hydraulics representations in the terrestrial biosphere model T\&C to understand the significance of plant hydraulics to ecosystem functioning. We tested representations of plant hydraulics, investigating plant water capacitance, and long-term xylem damages following drought. The four models we tested were a combination of representations including or neglecting capacitance and including or neglecting xylem damage legacies. Using the models at six case studies spanning semiarid to tropical ecosystems, we quantify how plant xylem flow, plant water storage and long-term xylem damage can modulate overall water and carbon dynamics across multiple time scales. We show that as drought develops, models with plant hydraulics predict a slower onset of plant water stress, and a diurnal variability of water and carbon fluxes closer to observations. Plant water storage was found to be particularly important for the diurnal dynamics of water and carbon fluxes, with models that include plant water capacitance yielding better results. Models including permanent damage to conducting plant tissues show an additional significant drought legacy effect, limiting plant productivity during the recovery phase following major droughts. However, when considering ecosystem responses to the observed climate variability, plant hydraulic modules alone cannot significantly improve the overall model performance, even though they reproduce more realistic water and carbon dynamics. This opens new avenues for model development, explicitly linking plant hydraulics with additional ecosystem processes, such as plant phenology and improved carbon allocation algorithms.},

	abstract = {Nocturnal stomatal conductance contributes to water loss at night without carbon gain in C3 or C4 plants because photosynthesis does not occur in the dark. The functional relevance of nocturnal conductance thus remains an unresolved conundrum. Here, we review and re-analyse previously published datasets on nocturnal conductance (gn) globally (176 species) to synthesize our current understanding on its potential biological function and to identify remaining research gaps. We found that gn was positively correlated with relative growth rate, which is compatible with the postulate that circadian-driven nocturnal conductance enhances predawn stomatal conductance, thereby priming stomata for photosynthesis in early daylight. The variation in gn across plant species and functional types was not consistent with the hypotheses that the main function of gn is to: remove excess CO2, which might limit growth; enhance oxygen delivery to the functional sapwood; enhance nutrient supply; or that gn is due to stomatal leakiness. We suggest further study regarding the potential of gn to be an important functional and ecological trait inﬂuencing competitive outcomes and we outline a research programme to achieve that objective.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A widespread increase in tree mortality has been observed
around the globe, and this trend is likely to continue because of ongoing
climate-induced increases in drought frequency and intensity. This raises
the need to identify regions and ecosystems that are likely to experience
the most frequent and significant damage. We present SurEau-Ecos, a trait-based,
plant hydraulic model designed to predict tree desiccation and mortality at
scales from stand to region. SurEau-Ecos draws on the general principles of the SurEau model
but introduces a simplified representation of plant architecture and
alternative numerical schemes. Both additions were made to facilitate model
parameterization and large-scale applications. In SurEau-Ecos, the water fluxes from
the soil to the atmosphere are represented through two plant organs (a leaf
and a stem, which includes the volume of the trunk, roots and branches) as
the product of an interface conductance and the difference between water
potentials. Each organ is described by its symplasmic and apoplasmic
compartments. The dynamics of a plant's water status beyond the point of
stomatal closure are explicitly represented via residual transpiration flow,
plant cavitation and solicitation of plants' water reservoirs. In addition
to the “explicit” numerical scheme of SurEau, we implemented a “semi-implicit”
and “implicit” scheme. Both schemes led to a substantial gain in computing
time compared to the explicit scheme ({\textgreater}10 000 times), and
the implicit scheme was the most accurate. We also observed similar plant
water dynamics between SurEau-Ecos and SurEau but slight disparities in infra-daily
variations of plant water potentials, which we attributed to the differences
in the representation of plant architecture between models. A global model's
sensitivity analysis revealed that factors controlling plant desiccation
rates differ depending on whether leaf water potential is below or above the
point of stomatal closure. Total available water for the plant, leaf area
index and the leaf water potential at 50 \% stomatal closure mostly drove
the time needed to reach stomatal closure. Once stomata are closed,
resistance to cavitation, residual cuticular transpiration and plant water
stocks mostly determined the time to hydraulic failure. Finally, we
illustrated the potential of SurEau-Ecos to simulate regional drought-induced mortality
over France. SurEau-Ecos is a promising tool to perform regional-scale predictions of
drought-induced hydraulic failure, determine the most vulnerable areas and
ecosystems to drying conditions, and assess the dynamics of forest
flammability.},
